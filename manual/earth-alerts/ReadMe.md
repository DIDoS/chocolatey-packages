## What is EARTH ALERTS?
Earth Alerts is an application that allows you to monitor in near real-time a variety of natural hazard events that are occurring anywhere around the world. Alert notifications, reports, and imagery provide the user with a convenient way to view natural phenomenon as they occur, whether close to home or some far-flung corner of the globe!

## Features
Earth Alerts includes basic weather tracking features such as National Weather Service alerts, current conditions, local forecasts and radar/satellite imagery. Note that this program does not provide the most extensive weather data or fanciest weather related imagery compared to what is available online. If weather information is all you're interested in, then Earth Alerts is probably NOT for you. There are many comprehensive applications, web browser add-ins, and websites available for monitoring weather.

Earth Alerts is a little program for anybody who is fascinated with the power of nature and enjoys keeping track of what our little blue planet is dishing out on a regular basis!
