RCKskimmer is able to search for digital signals (RTTY, BPSK31, BPSK63 and BPSK125) in a FFT-spectrum of a standard receiver like K3, FT1000x, ... or a SDR receiver with a NF-connection to the soundcard of the PC by using the MMVARI module.

All bands and frequencies can be scanned in a row.

All callsigns with CQ, QRZ, DE or TEST will be detected and listed with exactly mark-frequency by using the OmniRig Transceiver Control by VE3NEA, thanks Alex.

The callsigns are posted in real time to the RCK - Digital-Cluster-System what is specially designed for RCKskimmer and accessable for everyone and the spots are going also to the [www.reversebeacon.net](http://www.reversebeacon.net) network.
