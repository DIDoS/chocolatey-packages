Tartube is a GUI front-end for [youtube-dlc](https://pypi.org/project/youtube-dlc/), [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/) and other compatible video downloaders.

It is partly based on [youtube-dl-gui](https://mrs0m30n3.github.io/youtube-dl-gui/) and is written in Python 3 / Gtk 3. Tartube runs on MS Windows, Linux, BSD and MacOS.

## Features
### You can fetch a list of videos from your favourite channels and playlists on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), [BitChute](https://www.bitchute.com/), and hundreds of other websites (see [here](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html) for a full list)
### If buffering is an issue, you can download a temporary copy of a video before automatically opening it in your favourite media player
### **Tartube** will organise your videos into convenient folders (if that's what you want)
### **Tartube** can alert you when livestreams and debut videos are starting (**YouTube** only)
### If creators upload their videos to more than one website (**YouTube** and **BitChute**, for example), **Tartube** can interact with both sites without creating duplicates
### Certain websites operate an "only one opinion allowed" policy. If you think that the censors will remove a video, against the wishes of its creators and before you've had a chance to watch it, **Tartube** can make an archive copy
### Certain websites frequently place restrictions on a video, not because it is unsuitable for some audiences, but for purely political reasons. **Tartube** can, in some circumstances, see videos that are region-blocked and/or age-restricted
### Certain websites manipulate search results, repeatedly unsubscribe people from their favourite channels and/or deliberately conceal videos that they don't like. Tartube won't do any of those things
### If you want to listen to your favourite discussion videos, for example while driving a car, **Tartube** can make an archive copy of just the audio, rather than the full video
### Tartube is free and open-source software
