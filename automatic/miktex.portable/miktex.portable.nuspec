    <description><![CDATA[
MiKTeX (pronounced _mick-tech_) is an up-to-date implementation of TeX/LaTeX and related programs.
TeX is a typesetting system written by Donald Ervin Knuth who says that it is _intended for the creation of beautiful books - and especially for books that contain a lot of mathematics._

## Features
### Complete
A complete set of additions (programs, styles, fonts, …) are available to help you typeset your documents.

### Integrated package management
MiKTeX's integrated package manager installs missing components from the Internet, if required. This allows you to keep your TeX installation as minimal as possible (“Just enough TeX”).

### Always up-to-date
MiKTeX Console helps you to keep your TeX system up-to-date by installing the latest package updates.

### TeXworks included
MiKTeX comes with TeXworks, a TeX frontend which you can use it to edit and preview LaTeX documents.

### Well maintained
The MiKTeX package repository is updated regularly.

### Open source
MiKTeX is open source. You are welcome to redistribute MiKTeX under certain conditions.
