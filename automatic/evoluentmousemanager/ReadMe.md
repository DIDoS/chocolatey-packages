Evoluent Mouse Manager is an optional but powerful software that may be installed to configure the buttons to perform many common functions for VerticalMouse.. For example, button 2 may be configured to perform a double click with a single actual click to open a program, button 3 may be configured to open a link in a new tab, button 4 may be configured to cycle through open tabs, button 5 may be configured to close a tab, etc. This reduces the need to frequently move your hand between the mouse and the keyboard, and the need to move the mouse and click different areas of the screen.
