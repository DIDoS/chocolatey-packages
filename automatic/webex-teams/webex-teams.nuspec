    <description><![CDATA[**Make teamwork your best work.**
Whether on the go, at a desk, or together in a meeting room, Webex Teams helps speed up projects, build better relationships, and solve business challenges. It’s got all the team collaboration tools you need to keep work moving forward and connects with the other tools you use to simplify life.

## All the tools, all the time, everywhere.

## Amazing meetings built for team collaboration
Anyone using Webex Teams can start a meeting with a touch of a button. No more waiting on hosts. Join from anywhere and be able to switch devices seamlessly. And keep the conversation going after the meeting.

## Never miss a message.
Don’t let time—sensitive emails get lost in an overflowing inbox. Get your work done now with secure group messaging in Webex Teams. Send important information via direct and team messages, where they can be read and responded to right away—or flagged for follow up later. Keeping track of conversations is easy—all your messages are saved in the same space where you meet.

## Share files with the whole team.
File sharing and screen sharing in a space is quick and simple. And the files you receive are neatly organized, searchable, and saved right alongside all of your communication, so it’s easy to find what you’re looking for. Especially when you need to share in meetings.

## Show. Don’t tell.
Sometimes a quick sketch explains an idea better than words. White board or draw on your phone or any device, and share the interactive drawing in chat. Keep iterating whether or not you’re in a live meeting.

## Always secure.
Sharing is fun and productive but is it secure? Webex Teams keeps your information safe with a broad and holistic approach to security in the cloud.
